## Overview

Tech Blog is a full stack app that lets developers publish posts about various technologies and coding methodologies. Other developers can view these posts and leave comments on them. 

## Future Development

The app does not currently allow posts to be edited/updated. I would like to add such functionality to both posts and comments, as well as overhaul the CSS styles for the entire app.
